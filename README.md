# üè≠ Copacetic Scanner Plugin Template

This is a template repo for creating a scanner plugin for [Copacetic](https://github.com/project-copacetic/copacetic).

Learn more about Copacetic's scanner plugins [here](https://project-copacetic.github.io/copacetic/).

## Development

These instructions are for developing a new scanner plugin for [Copacetic](https://github.com/project-copacetic/copacetic) from this template.

1. Clone this repo
2. Rename the `scanner-plugin-template` repo to the name of your plugin
3. Update applicable types for [`FakeReport`](types.go) to match your scanner's structure
4. Update [`parse`](main.go) to parse your scanner's report format accordingly
5. Update `CLI_BINARY` in the [`Makefile`](Makefile) to match your scanner's CLI binary name (resulting binary must be prefixed with `copa-`)
5. Update this [`README.md`](README.md) to match your plugin's usage

## Example Usage

```shell
# assuming $GOPATH/bin or $GOBIN is in $PATH
go install github.com/project-copacetic/scanner-plugin-template@latest

# rename binary to copa-<scanner name> (e.g. copa-fake)
mv $GOPATH/bin/scanner-plugin-template $GOPATH/bin/copa-fake

# test plugin with example config
copa-fake testdata/fake_report.json

export IMAGE="<image to be patched>"

# run copa with the scanner plugin (copa-fake) and the report file
copa patch -i $IMAGE -r testdata/fake_report.json --scanner fake
```
